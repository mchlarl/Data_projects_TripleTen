# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |

| 1 | Superstore High Returned Items Analysis| The project involved analyzing highly returned items from the Superstore. I also analyzed the data by geographic location, as some areas tend to have higher refund rates. A high return rate doesn't necessarily mean the products are bad; it might be related to seasonal factors!|
